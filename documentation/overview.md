# Project overview

It’s a trip-planning application designed to help you manage your budget, tickets, hotel bookings, destinations, and more.
The app is aimed at people who want to organize and track their trips in one place.
It helps you when you’re unsure how much money you’ve spent and what you’ve spent it on.

It is NOT an app to:

- Buy tickets.

- Book hotels.

- Suggest places to visit.

- Automatically track your bills from external services.

Instead, it focuses on manual trip management, giving you a clear overview of your expenses, itinerary, and essential travel details without relying on external booking systems.
